## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed
- [ ] Check Railway logs for error
- [ ] Verify all files pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Check requirements.txt is correct
- [ ] Verify Python version (should be 3.11)
- [ ] Try manual deploy in Railway

### App Won't Start
- [ ] Check Railway logs
- [ ] Verify environment variables set
- [ ] No extra spaces in variable values
- [ ] SECRET_KEY is set
- [ ] Check Procfile syntax

### Chat Not Working
- [ ] OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable set
- [ ] Key has credits (check openrouter.ai)
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `/health`

### Workflows Not Creating
- [ ] All 3 API keys set in Railway
- [ ] No typos in key values
- [ ] Keys have correct permissions
- [ ] Check logs for specific errors

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Daily Checks
- [ ] App still running (check Railway dashboard)
- [ ] No deployment failures
- [ ] Error rate acceptable
- [ ] Workflow executions succeeding

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review costs (Railway + API usage)
- [ ] Check video generation success rate
- [ ] Review social media posting success
- [ ] Update workflows based on performance

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If App Crashes
1. Check Railway logs
2. Look for error message
3. Ask AI in chat (if accessible): "Debug the error: [paste error]"
4. Redeploy from Railway dashboard
5. Check environment variables still set

### If Running Out of Credits
1. Check OpenRouter usage
2. Top up credits at openrouter.ai
3. Reduce workflow frequency temporarily
4. Monitor costs going forward

### If Videos Not Posting
1. Check Blotato dashboard
2. Verify account connections
3. Check account IDs in workflow config
4. Re-authenticate accounts if needed
